Your country’s data protection laws may not apply and may be more stringent than those to which Orma Health is legally subject. Personal Data may be transmitted to third parties, which parties may store or maintain the data on their secure servers. These third parties are not permitted to transfer your Personal Data outside of the United States.</p></div><h2>Will we share your Personal Data with anyone else?</h2><div style="font-size: 0.7em;"><p><u>Yes, with third parties that help us power our Platform.</u> Orma Health has a limited number of service providers and other third parties (“Business Partners”) that help us run various aspects of our business. These Business Partners are contractually bound to protect Your Personal Data and to use it only for the limited purpose(s) for which it is shared. Business Partners’ use of Personal Data may include, but is not limited to, the provision of services such as data hosting, information security, IT services, customer service, and billing management.</p><p><u>Yes, with third parties and the government when legal or enforcement issues arise.</u> We may share your Personal Data, if reasonable and necessary, to (i) comply with legal processes or enforceable governmental requests, or as otherwise required by law; (ii) cooperate with third parties in investigating acts in violation of this Agreement; or (iii) bring legal action against someone who may be violating <a href="./terms-of-use.html">the Terms of Use</a> or who may be causing intentional or unintentional injury or interference to the rights or property of Orma Health or any third-party, including other users.</p><p><u>Yes, with third parties that provide advisory services.</u> We may share Your Personal Data with Our lawyers, auditors, accountants, or banks, when We have a legitimate business interest in doing so.</p><p><u>Yes, with third parties in the event of a reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer, or other disposition of all or any portion of Orma Health’s corporate entity, assets, or stock (including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings).</u> If We share Your Personal Data with a third-party other than as provided above, You will be notified at the time of data collection or transfer, and You will have the option of not permitting the transfer.</p></div><h2>What is “anonymized data” and what will We do with it?</h2><div style="font-size: 0.7em;"><p>We may, from time to time, rent or sell aggregated data and/or other information that does not contain any personal identifiers (i.e., the information has been anonymized by stripping out identifiers such as name, address, phone number, etc.). The purpose of this type of disclosure is to describe the Platform to current and prospective business partners and other third parties. The anonymized data may also be shared or published through academic journals or media platforms for lawful purposes. Once your data is anonymized, it is no longer Personal Data, and we are not restricted in our use of that data for any purpose.</p></div><h2>How long do We retain Personal Data?</h2><div style="font-size: 0.7em;"><p>We will retain your Personal Data for as long as you maintain a User Account and up to 7 years after the account is closed. The exact period of retention will depend on the type of Personal Data, our contractual obligation to you, and applicable law. We keep your Personal Data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected, unless otherwise required or necessary pursuant to a legitimate business purpose outlined herein. At the end of the applicable retention period, we will remove your Personal Data from our databases and will request that our Business Partners remove your Personal Data from their databases. If there is any data that we are unable, for technical reasons, to delete entirely from our systems, we will put in place appropriate measures to prevent any further processing of such data. We retain anonymized data indefinitely. Contact Us at <a href="mailto:privacy@ormahealth.com">privacy@ormahealth.com</a> regarding the applicable data retention period for your Personal Data.</p><p>NOTE: Once we disclose your Personal Data to third parties, we may not be able to access that Personal Data any longer and cannot force the deletion or modification of any such information by the parties to whom we have made those disclosures. Written requests for deletion of Personal Data other than as described should be directed to <a href="mailto:privacy@ormahealth.com">privacy@ormahealth.com</a>.</p></div><h2>How do we protect your Personal Data?</h2><div style="font-size: 0.7em;"><p>Orma Health is committed to protecting the security and confidentiality of your Personal Data. We use a combination of reasonable physical, technical, and administrative security controls to maintain the security and integrity of your Personal Data, to protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such information, and to protect against unauthorized access to or use of such information in our possession or control that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to you. However, Internet data transmissions, whether wired or wireless, cannot be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, we cannot absolutely ensure the security of information you transmit to us. By using the Platform, you are assuming this risk.</p><p><u>Safeguards.</u> The information collected by Orma Health and stored on secure servers is protected by a combination of technical, administrative, and physical security safeguards, such as authentication, encryption, backups, and access controls.
